      Cool Dragon Poem
      <br>
   </h1>
   <pre>
      Once they all believed in dragons
      When the world was fresh and young 
      We woven into legends
      Tales were told and songs were sung
      We were treated wit h obieisance 
      We were honored, we were feared
      Then one day they stoppped believing 
      On that day, we disappeared
      Now they say our time is over
      Now they say we've lived our last 
      Now we're treated with derision
      Where once we ruled unsurpassed
      We must make them all remember 
      In some way we must reveal
      That our spirit lives forever
      We are dragons! We are real!
